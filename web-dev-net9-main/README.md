# Code solutions for Visual Studio, VS Code, and Rider

Visual Studio, VS Code + C# Dev Kit, and Rider can use the same code solution file and projects. 

To use the solution file with VS Code:
1. Install the **C# Dev Kit** extension.
2. In VS Code, open the *folder* that contains a `.sln` solution file.
3. Wait for the **SOLUTION EXPLORER** pane to appear in the **EXPLORER**. 

> **Warning!** If you use multiple code editors to open the same solution, be aware that the build process can conflict. This is because Visual Studio has its own non-standard build server that is different from the standard build server used by .NET SDK CLI. My recommendation is to only have a solution open in one code editor at any time. 
 
You can "clean" a solution between opening it in different code editors, either using the `dotnet clean` command or manually. For example, after closing the solution in one code editor, I often delete the `bin` and `obj` folders before then opening in a different code editor.

# Microsoft Certifications

Announcing the New Foundational C# Certification with freeCodeCamp:
https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-foundational-csharp-certification/

Microsoft used to have professional exams and certifications for developers that covered skills like C# and ASP.NET. Sadly, they have retired them all. These days, the only developer-adjacent exams and certifications are for Azure or Power Platform, as you can see from the certification poster: https://aka.ms/traincertposter
