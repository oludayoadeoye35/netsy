# Raising issues with the book

If you get stuck following any of the instructions in this book, or if you spot a mistake in the text or the code in the solutions, please raise an issue in the GitHub repository:
1.	Use your favorite browser to navigate to the following link: https://github.com/markjprice/web-dev-net9/issues.
2.	Click **New Issue**.
3.	Enter as much detail as possible that will help me to diagnose the issue. For example:
    - The specific section title, page number, and step number.
    - Your code editor, for example, Visual Studio, VS Code, Rider, or something else, including the version number.
    - As much of your code and configuration that you feel is relevant and necessary.
    - A description of the expected behavior and the behavior experienced.
    - Screenshots (you can drag and drop image files into the Issue box).

The following is less relevant but might be useful:
- Your operating system, for example, Windows 11 64-bit, or macOS Ventura version 13.5.2
- Your hardware, for example, Intel, Apple Silicon, or ARM CPU

Issues with ASP.NET Core are often complex and are affected by everything from configuration to code, so it may be of benefit for me to see a whole project. In that scenario, please provide what Microsoft calls a “minimal repro project” that illustrates the problem without unnecessary code, as described at the following link: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/blob/main/docs/repro.md

Please share your “minimal repro project” with me in a public GitHub repository because I cannot open ZIP attachments, and please don't include any confidential content. I will then be able to reproduce your issue and be more likely to help you fix it.

I cannot always respond immediately to issues. But I want all my readers to be successful with my book, so if I can help you (and others) without too much trouble, then I will gladly do so.

Keep in mind that I live in the UK so if you live in USA then it might be evening time for me when you are working on coding and I likely won’t see your issue until the next day.

# Giving me feedback

If you'd like to give me more general feedback about the book, then either email me at markjprice@gmail.com or ask me a question on Discord in the book channel. You can provide the feedback anonymously, or if you would like a response from me, then you can supply an email address. I will only use this email address to answer your feedback.

Please join me and your fellow readers on Discord using this invite: https://packt.link/web-dev-net9-discord  .

I love to hear from my readers about what they like about my book, as well as suggestions for improvements and how they are working with C# and .NET, so don't be shy. Please get in touch!

Thank you in advance for your thoughtful and constructive feedback.
